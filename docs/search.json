    "text": "Data Science vs Statistics\nData science and statistics are two field that are intimately linked with one another, albeit with different focuses. Data science is more focused on the management of data using statistical software while statistics is more focused on the analysis of data using mathematical models. In a way it can be thought of as the difference between an applied and theoretical science, in which data science would be the applied science and statistics the theoretical science. Overall, both fields are quite similar and utilize similar/the same practices. software, techniques, and theories."
